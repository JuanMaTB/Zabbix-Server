# Zabbix-Server
 Automatic installer for Zabbix Server Standalone

Instaling Zabbix might be a bit complex for those who try it for the first time, so i have decided to put togheter a small script that automates all the steps to perform the installation of Zabbix Standalone Server.

In the "install.sh" file are some variables that can be changed in order to set up your installation properly.

The script is not perfect and I will keep working on it to improve it.

My goal with this is to help people that is facing Zabbix installation for the first time and finds it complicated.

**Remember to edit the variables at the begining of the script befoore launching it**

I hope you find it usefull.
